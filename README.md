# Torso Ninja

Torso Ninja is a scrolling shooter video game with a twist: you can't shoot back! Guide our hero, the eponymous
Torso Ninja, through waves of shuriken hurled by his enemies, and try to get the high score by staying alive as
long as possible!

Torso Ninja was originally created in December of 2015 as part of the [One Game A Month Challenge](http://www.onegameamonth.com/). At the time 
of its original release, Torso Ninja was only distributed in binary format. The source code is being released
